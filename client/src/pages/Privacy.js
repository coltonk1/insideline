            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
                setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored

                finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
                future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
