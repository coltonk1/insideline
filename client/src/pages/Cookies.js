                This Cookie Policy explains how Inside Line Properties, LLC ("Company," "we," "us," and "our") uses cookies and similar
                technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at{" "}
                <a href="https://insidelineproperties.com" target="_blank">
                    https://insidelineproperties.com
                </a>{" "}
                ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it
                with other information.

            <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely
                used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Inside Line Properties, LLC) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set
                by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or
                functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties
                that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it
                visits certain other websites.
            </p>

            <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
            <p>
                We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
                Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to
                track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
                through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
            </p>

            <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
            <p>
                You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your
                preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you
                accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you
                may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also
                set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.

            <h2>How can I control cookies on my browser?</h2>
            <p>
                As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should
                visit your browser's help menu for more information. The following is information about how to manage cookies on the most
                popular browsers:

            <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time
                to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a
                unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This
                allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or
                communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a
                third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many
                instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
                functioning.
            </p>

            <h2>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>
            <p>
                Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things,
                collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash
                Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going
                to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for
                example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs
                from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies
                that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the
                functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or
                online content.

            <h2>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>
            <p>
                Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website. These companies
                may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and
                services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
                advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this
                and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The
                information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details, or other
                details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
            </p>

            <h2>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for
                other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed
                about our use of cookies and related technologies.
